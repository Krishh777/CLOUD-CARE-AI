📑 Project Report (Problem, Solution, Outcome)
🏷️ Project Title:
Healthcare Management System Using SQL

🔍 Problem Statement:
Modern-day hospitals come across many hurdles in maintain real-time availability of doctors, recording bed occupancy with accuracy, and in helping patients locate a pharmacy with requisite medicine. Lack of a centralized and dynamically operating system in periods of high stress, such as pandemics or emergency situations, leads to care getting delayed, resources being mismatched, and general confusion.

✅ Proposed Solution:
The project is essentially a Healthcare Management System built on SQL which aims at providing a real-time, structured, and automated backend system for hospital and pharmacy operations comprising:

Doctor Availability Tracking: A stored procedure returns the list of doctors present at this very moment based on live time.

Bed Usage Log Auto Update: Triggers auto update available_beds in Hospitals table when a new bed log is inserted or updated.

Medicine Stock Checker: Stored procedure to search medicine availability across all pharmacies by name.

Nearest Pharmacy View: Simple view to get all pharmacies in a given city and area.

Well-Defined ER Diagram: With: Designed with normalized relations and foreign key integrity, supporting scalability.

🌍 Real-World Impact:
Helps ensure quick response during health crises.

Emergency dispatchers use this to pinpoint hospitals with vacant beds.

Helps patients or staff in locating medicine stock without manual telephone calls.

Lays the foundation for a hospital dashboard accessible via a website or mobile device.

It can be further expanded to introduce user logins, appointment scheduling, billing, and inventory-related alerts.

🧠 Tools Used:
Database: MySQL 8.0

Design: MySQL Workbench (ER Diagram)

SQL Concepts: Joins, Views, Triggers, Stored Procedures, Constraints

📌 Conclusion:
The project can provide a scalable backend model for the real-world healthcare system and can act as a solid foundation for further development of integrated hospital or pharmaceutical application software.
